Methodology  -
This study integrates historical trader-level transaction data from the Hyperliquid platform with sentiment data from the Bitcoin market (the Fear & Greed Index).
To investigate the effects of market sentiment on trader behavior and performance, both datasets were aligned at a daily granularity.

Important behavioral indicators were created for each trader each day, such as:
Profit and loss per day (PnL)
The quantity of transactions
Average size of trade
Leverage average (proxy)
ratio of long-to-short trades
Rate of victory

Fear and Greed regimes were used to categorize market sentiment.
To assess variations in performance and behavior among these regimes, statistical comparisons and visual analysis were employed.
In order to predict daily trader profitability, a baseline Logistic Regression model was also constructed using sentiment and 
behavioral features. For efficiency and generalization, high-cardinality identifiers were eliminated.

Insights  -

Sentiment regime affects performance differently.
Fear days cause Trader PnL to be more erratic, with a greater range of gains and losses. On greed days, average performance is comparatively more consistent and favorable.

Changes in behavior when experiencing fear
Traders typically decrease average position size and increase trade frequency and leverage during fear regimes. This implies trading behavior that is emotional or reactive.

Sentiment risk is increased by leverage.
While gains during Greed days are not proportionately higher, high-leverage traders perform noticeably worse during Fear days than low-leverage traders.

Well-behaved traders perform better than
Better risk management is demonstrated by traders who trade less frequently and maintain consistent position sizes, as evidenced by their more stable performance across both sentiment regimes.

Strategy Recommendations - 

Control of Fear Regime Risk
To prevent increased losses brought on by market volatility and emotional overtrading, traders should limit trade frequency and reduce leverage during fear periods.

Optimization of the Greed Regime
Keeping disciplined leverage while permitting slightly larger position sizes can increase returns during Greed periods without appreciably raising risk.

Trading by Segment
Consistent, low-frequency traders profit from sticking to stable strategies across regimes, while high-leverage and high-frequency traders should implement more stringent 
risk controls based on sentiment.
